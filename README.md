# Arke

This is a split keyboard designed for my own needs. It features 12deg rotated main alpha cluster like the original Alice-style boards. The name derives from [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arke). The board is shaped vaguely like wings, so I chose a figure who lost their wings. The name Arke also means "swift", which I feel is appropriate given this layout improves my typing speed!

## How to use `ergogen.yml`

**This particular file was written for Ergogen 4.x! It will not work on 3.x!**

This file is used with [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), a keyboard generator focused on ergonomic, usually columnar stagger boards. It can still work with row-stagger, but needs more work to do so.
