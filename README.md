# Arke

This is a split keyboard designed for my own needs. It features 12deg rotated main alpha cluster like the original Alice-style boards.

## How?

I am using [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) via [cache.works](https://ergogen.cache.works/). Insert ergogen.yaml data into their site and you can download the files.
